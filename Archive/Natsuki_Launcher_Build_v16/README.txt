You can run the launcher using NatsukiLauncher.exe

You can run the Sample Window using SampleWindow.exe
(it does noting besides being detected by the character as a pushable window)

NOTE: please run the Sample Window before Natsuki, cuz rn it only detects programs once (when it starts)

 note: if you dont want to run it using the launcher, you have the original build at:
'\build\main\'

Launcher ContextMenu documentation:

"Run Menu Manage" - TBI (to be implemented) - 
- shows a window with assistant properties like calibarting the display size/managing the instance

"Tell A Fun Joke" - TBI (to be implemented) - 
- this is here pretty much to remind me of adding a cross-communication system between the launcher and the Unity Assistant.

"Go to sleep" - in Short: "Close Assistant"
Closes the assistant completely. It is planned to make a 'going to sleep' animation for the character before the assistant window is actually closed. (as soon as i implement the communication)

"Force restart" - yeah it does what it says.
It restarts the assistant (including the launcher itself), and upon next launch, it automatically starts up the assistant executable.

You can run the 'ResetConfig.exe' to reset all of your launcher data
